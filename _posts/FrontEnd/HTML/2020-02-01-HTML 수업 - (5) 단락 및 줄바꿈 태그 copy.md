HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets . Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

# 결론
1. p 태그를 이용하여 단락을, br 태그를 이용하여 줄바꿈을 지정할 수 있습니다.
2. br 태그는 한 개만 사용 시 개행의 역할만 하고, 두 개 이상 사용 시 외관상 p 태그와 유사하게 동작합니다.
3. 일부 단락에서 p 태그의 간격을 더 넓히고 싶을 때 br 태그를 추가하여 조절 할 수 있습니다.
4. p 태그 기본 간격을 변경하고 싶을 때는 css를 이용하여 변경할 수 있습니다.
